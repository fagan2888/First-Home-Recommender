WEIGHT,Final weight,"Each housing unit in the AHS represents itself and a number of other units. In order to develop estimates using the AHS the final weight must be applied to the survey data. The final weight starts with the inverse of the sampling fraction (PWT) and incorporates several adjustment factors that minimize sampling errors and errors from incomplete survey data. The Noninterview Adjustment Factor increases the weight of each interviewed unit to account for sampled units that were not interviewed. This adjustment is applied to five classes of geography: central cities, urban and rural inside MSAs, urban and rural outside MSAs. Over time the geographic boundaries related to these five classes may be redefined by local or state governments. For National surveys, WEIGHT uses the boundaries as they were officially defined in 1980. For Metro surveys, WEIGHT uses the boundaries as they were defined in the decennial year prior to the survey year. More information on weighting can be found at www.census.gov/programs-surveys/ahs/tech-documentation/def-errors-changes.html. WEIGHT may be used with all Metro surveys, and for National survey years 1997, 1999, and 2015 and later.

When electricity is billed separately or can be modeled separately, the models estimate electricity consumption, which is converted into costs with price data. When the electric bill is combined with a utility that cannot be modeled separately (i.e., oil, other fuels, trash, water), the models estimate costs with additional information on either the last bill or the respondent's best estimate of average monthly electric costs. Amounts are for occupied units that use and pay for electricity, where the electricity cost is not included in rent, site rent, condo fee, or other fee, or included in another utility cost.
